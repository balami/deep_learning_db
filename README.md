# Deep Learning for Cardinality Estimation

A Deep Learning approach to cardinality estimation in Relational Databases. The neural network model is trained on the random queries generated by the query generator as well as the complex queries from [Join Order Benchmark (JOB)](https://github.com/gregrahn/join-order-benchmark#join-order-benchmark) (70% of 113 queries),
which consists queries with multiple joins upto 15 joins in a single query.
The remaining queries are used for testing. PostgreSQL's optimizer (using EXPLAIN ANALYZE) is used to get the estimations for training as well as for the baseline comparison.

[FastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html#models) is used to embed the string predicates in queries.
